If you want to grab metadata from the excel spreadsheet for now (with the expectation that specifically what will be
included will change) i’d say we tentatively want to include diagnosis age, BCLC stage, cancer type detailed,
differentiation, Etiology, and sex

For meta-data, would be good to add these to your suggestions:
Disease stage
Liver fibrosis ishak score category
Tumour size
Vascular invasion
Immune Subtype (C1-C6)
TCGA Subtype (iClusters, C1-C6, and stemness)

Please see attached the excel file with ICGC samples and highlighted meta-data.


Her is the explanation for additional meta-data:
HCC happens mostly in cirrhosis, and also in non-cirrhotic livers. Disease stage has this data and later we can compare it to our mice tumours especially on high sugar diet (HS) which don’t show fibrosis. F0-F4 in disease stage refers to degree of fibrosis based on Ishak scoring (next).
Ishak score from F0 (non) to F4 (highest in cirrhosis) shows different degree of liver fibrosis
We can leave no. 3 out if you think it’s not going to show much
Same for no. 4
If we could find immune modules related to C1-C6 and impute to Metabolic/NAFLD group will be great.
Will be great to use the cell paper. I read it again today. If you have any suggestion about TCGA subtypes that I picked please let me know. I picked stemness as one group here is working on cancer stem cells and we might incorporate the results with their models as a different project with functional analysis.
